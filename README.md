## Overview

This Workshop will be an introduction to nodejs as a network system for web applications. We will cover the basics of how to serve http(s) traffic and __how to approach__ the creation of web applications by using expressjs. The main exercise will be the creation of a web application to display nearby photos from Flickr API.

## Disclaimer

This workshop will not teach you how to write javascript code, we assume you already know how to do that for the browser (if not, please check http://mzl.la/1nNiLCB). This is a hands-on workshop but with a lot of information to digest, make sure you arrive fresh and full of energy :)
